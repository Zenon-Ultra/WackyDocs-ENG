                        "However, while the small explosions sealed off the entrances, they left the rest of the mines and the works of art unharmed. When the Monuments Men arrived and squeezed their way into the mines, they must have been amazed to see what was inside.",
                        "There were thousands of priceless objects, including paintings, statues, books, furniture, and more. The Monuments Men thought it would take about one year to transport everything they found to a safe location.",
                        "However, because control of the area was going to change at the end of the war, they would have access to the mines for just two months. With insufficient packing supplies and only a few trucks, the transporting mission seemed impossible.",

                        "They used coats and gas masks as packing materials and did everything they could to accomplish this vital mission in time. In the end, the Monuments Men succeeded in rescuing thousands of stolen works of art, including important pieces such as Jan van Eyck's Adoration of the Mystic Lamb, Johannes Vermeer's The Astronomer, and Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges."
