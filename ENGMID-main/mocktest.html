    "Rome was said to have been a melting pot from the very start.",
    "The historian Livy claimed the city's original population was comprised of immigrants flooding in from all directions, attracted by Romulus's deliberate policy of nondiscrimination.",
    "It was this initial openness, Livy asserts, that laid the foundations for the later strength and success of the city.",
    "Romans described their city as multicultural in the generations after its foundation.",
    "Tradition held that only a minority of the city's legendary kings were Roman-born, with the others all arriving as immigrants before being chosen for the throne for their virtues and merits.",
    "As the empire expanded across three continents, Rome eagerly adopted new cultural influences and absorbed incoming groups ― perhaps a little too eagerly for some, who, like the poet Juvenal, complained about the rapid rate of cultural change."

    "The laws and constants of physics and the fundamental forces in our universe have very precise forms and values.",
    "This means that, if they were only very slightly different, life would not have been possible.",
    "For instance, the precise value of gravity has enabled our universe to arise by permitting the aggregation of dust and gas particles to proto-stars around which planets later came to orbit, including the Earth around the Sun.",
    "If the value of the electron had been ever so slightly larger or smaller, chemistry, as we know it, would not have been possible and life, which is based on organic chemistry, could not have started.",
    "The universe was not designed for us to evolve, we have no privileged position in the universe; however, the laws and constants of physics allowed advanced life to evolve."
